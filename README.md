# girls-power
This project creates a button and a paragraph element in the HTML file with a message empowering girls. The CSS file styles the button and paragraph in a centered container with a pink color theme. The JavaScript file adds an event listener to the button so that when it is clicked, the text content of the paragraph changes to a message celebrating girls power.
